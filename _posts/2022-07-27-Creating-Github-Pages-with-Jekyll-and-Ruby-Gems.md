## Overview  
I created this tutorial as a sample for my technical writing portfolio.

## Tools Used
Markdown, Ubuntu, Atom (Text Editor), Git, GitHub, GitHub Pages

## Documentation Plan

### Audience
This tutorial is for all users who want to create GitHub pages with Jekyll site for a portfolio, website or a blog.

### Benefits
This tutorial provides a step-by-step approach on how to create a portfolio, blog or a non-commercial website on GitHub pages using a static website generator called Jekyll.

### Results
I documented this tutorial after installing Jekyll bundler with ruby gems on Ubuntu terminal environment with Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL). I followed the steps (as mentioned) in Official GitHub Pages to create a portfolio hosted directly from my public repository. Using Atom text editor, I crafted a detailed process of creating GitHub pages using Jekyll.
